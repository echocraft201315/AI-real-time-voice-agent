# Voice Agent 

A real-time voice-to-voice conversation system that enables natural, fluid interactions with AI. This system processes human speech, understands context, and responds with natural-sounding voice, all in real-time.

## ‚ú® Features
1. **Event-Driven**: The architecture revolves around the events of receiving audio chunks, processing them, and responding in real-time.
2. **Real-Time**: It is designed to minimize latency, ensuring conversational interactions.
3. **Audio Processing**: Handles audio streams, transcription, LLM responses, and TTS generation efficiently.
4. **Redis Queue Integration**: Utilizes Redis queues for user-specific message handling, ensuring organized processing of transcriptions and responses. Each user gets their dedicated queue, preventing message mixing across different conversations.
5. **FIFO Processing**: Maintains strict First-In-First-Out order for each user's responses, ensuring conversational coherence and natural dialogue flow.
6. **Stateful Processing**: Redis queues maintain conversation state and message order per user, allowing for context-aware responses and proper sentence sequencing during TTS generation.
7. **Lightweight**: Redis's in-memory nature provides extremely low latency for queue operations while maintaining message persistence.
8. **User Isolation**: Dedicated queues per user ensure that concurrent conversations remain isolated and don't interfere with each other's processing flow.
9. **Sentence-Level Processing:** Smart sentence boundary detection for natural speech synthesis

  - Deepgram 

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spandan114/AI-realtime-voice-agent.git
cd AI-realtime-voice-agent
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

REDIS_HOST="localhost"
REDIS_PORT="6379"
```

### Running the Application
1. Start the server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

2. The API will be available at:
- WebSocket: `ws://localhost:8000/ws`
- REST API: `http://localhost:8000/`

3. Start frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
4. The UI will be available at:
- `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

## Component Description

### Frontend
- Handles microphone input capture
- Streams audio chunks to WebSocket server
- Plays received audio responses

### Socket Server
- Manages WebSocket connections
- Routes audio chunks to Deepgram API
- Handles real-time communication

### Backend Processing
- Integrates with Deepgram for real-time transcription
- Implements 1-second pause detection
- Processes transcripts through LLM
- Collects and validates complete sentences

### Queue System
- Redis-based FIFO queue
- Ensures ordered processing of responses
- Manages TTS processing states

### TTS System
- Generates audio from text responses
- Streams audio chunks back to frontend
- Maintains sequential processing
